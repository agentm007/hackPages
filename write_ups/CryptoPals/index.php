      <p>Cryptopals is a series of challenges about cryptography. Part of the
         challenge involves building your own library. Though the challenges may
         be done in any language I chose to use python to finish them quickly.
         Below are link to each of the challenges that I have completed and a
         write up on the particular challenge. If you have not done the challenges
         before please try and figure them out on your own. The finished version
         of the code can be found on my github https://github.com/agentm007. If
         you have any questions on the Challenges feel free to email me. I may or
         may not answer.</p>
